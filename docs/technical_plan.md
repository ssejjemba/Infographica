# Infographic Animation Library - Technical Documentation

The Infographic Animation Library aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for developers and creators to generate animated infographics from a JSON configuration. This documentation covers the foundational decisions made, the JSON structure to be used, and the reasoning behind each.

## Technical Direction

### **Flexibility & Extensibility**:

One of the library's primary goals is to remain flexible. This approach ensures that while it's easy for beginners to get started, advanced users can also tweak and fine-tune details to get their desired outcomes.

### **Configurability**:

Given the myriad ways infographics can be designed and the various animation styles possible, a JSON-based configuration offers users the flexibility to define their preferences explicitly.

### **Usability**:

While we aim for configurability, we also ensure that the library remains user-friendly, with sensible defaults and intuitive structures.

## JSON Data Structure

### **1. Metadata**:

Holds general information about the infographic.

### **2. Background**:

Defines the base layer, including any images or base colors.

### **3. Elements**:

A list of all visual components (e.g., graphs, text, images) and their respective properties.

#### **3.1 Animation**:

Details the animation type, duration, any delays, and the easing function.

- `delay`: Delays the start of an animation, offering sequencing control.
- `easing`: Specifies animation easing type for dynamic movements.

#### **3.2 Text Attributes**:

For text elements, further granularity with font and shadow attributes.

- `font`: Defines font family and weight.
- `shadow`: Adds shadows for better text visibility.

#### **3.3 Graph Legends**:

Legends help interpret graphs.

- `show`: Toggle legend display.
- `position`: Define legend position.
- `labels`: Custom naming for data series.

### **4. Transitions**:

Defines how one element transitions to the next.

## Reasoning Behind Structure

1. **Separating Elements and Transitions**: By having a clear separation, we allow users to define each element of their infographic in isolation and then specify how they'd like to transition between them.

2. **Animation Attributes**: Including `delay` and `easing` provides more control over how animations play out, ensuring a more polished final product.

3. **Fine-grained Text Control**: Text is a critical component of infographics. By giving users control over font and shadow properties, they can ensure their text is readable and aesthetically pleasing.

4. **Graph Legends**: Many infographics will utilize graphs. Legends are a critical component of making these understandable.

## Future Considerations

As we develop and gather user feedback, we'll look into expanding our feature set, perhaps including more animation types, interactive elements, and better integration with existing design tools.

This structure and direction provide a foundation upon which the library can be built. Continuous iteration, feedback, and testing will be critical to its success.
